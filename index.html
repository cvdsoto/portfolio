      Hello There! I'm Carmina Soto and I am a junior front-end developer.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I knew I wanted to design websites ever since I was in high school and I thought getting a degree in Information Technology would automatically get me that job. Little did I know that websites were only a part of it and I was pretty much overwhelmed with all the possibilities IT has to offer. After graduating, I was given a chance to work as an IT trainee and I worked my way up to become an SAP ABAP Consultant. Though I was not designing websites, I did my best to use my passion in design through creating reports, forms, and system enhancements.</p>
